Snowflake data ingestion
=========================================================

We will learn the core features of loading data into the snowflake stage area. A stage is a temporary storage area in the snowflake warehouse. Stage area is used to load data into tables. 

 

Stage areas in the snowflake 
----------------------------

There are main **three** stage areas in the snowflake
- The User Stage 
- Table Stage 
- Internal Named Stage

***********************
The User Stage
***********************
Each snowflake user is attached to the default user stage to store the file. This stage area is only accessible by specific user

.. code-block:: rst

    put file://D:\filelocation\filename.csv @~/staged; 

The above statment will copy the filename.csv from the given location to userstage area in the snowflake warehouse. 
The content of this stage area can be checked with

.. code-block:: rst

    list @~/staged; 

.. note::  The user stages are referenced using @~.
    For example, use LIST @~ to list the files in a user stage 

***********************
Table Stage
***********************
Each table has a Snowflake stage allocated for storing files. Multiple users can access a single table stage area

.. code-block:: rst

    put file://D:\filelocation\filename.csv @%test; 

You can also specify the subfolder within the table stage where you want to upload files

.. code-block:: rst

    put file://D:\filelocation\filename.csv @%test/sample_csv/; 

Table stages have the same name as the table. The table stages cannot be altered or dropped.
Table stages do not support setting file format options. Instead, specify file format details in your **COPY** command.
To get simply list of the files in table stage area, use **LIST @%test**

***********************
Internal Named Stage
***********************
Internal stages are named database objects. 
Internal named stages are the recommended stage to load the tables. 
The Internal named stages can be accessed by multiple users. 
Internal stage can load multiple tables.
File formats can be specified while creating an internal Named stage. 
In our project we will be using internal named stage to copy our data from different sources.
