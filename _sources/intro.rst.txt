Data platform overview
=============================

Modern data architecture allow enterprises to ingest data coming from
multiple systems, variety of data formats, different speeds, and unknown
intervals. Layered data platform design makes it easy to process big
data efficiently. It enables organizations to quickly deploy new data
analytics business case driven solution to drive revenue and
profitability.

Data source layer
-----------------

-  Data sources can be inside the enterprise or external  
-  Data sources generate data in real-time and batch mode   
-  Variety: Data formats can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured   
-  The Velocity (speed of arrival) and Volume (delivery rate) will differ by sources 

Data processing and storage layer
---------------------------------

Receives data from the source, converts the data into a format
comprehensible for the data servicing and analytics tool, and stores the
data according to its format. For example, Large amount of data can be
stored in a Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) store. Large data
processing can be performed through Hadoop/Spark system. Data may
undergo format changes as it is processed through these systems. Cloud
service providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft allow to build and
operate data-centric applications with infinite scale. Robust and
inexpensive storage is fundamental to the operation and scalability of
big data architecture. 

Big query, azure synapse, redshift, and snowflake
are used as standalone solution for big data processing or in
combination of Hadoop/spark ecosystems

Analytics layer
---------------

The analytical layer reads the data ingested and transformed by the data
processing and storage layer of big data ecosystem. This layer consists
varieties of data analytic tools for different user requirements. This
layer provides the data discovery mechanisms from the huge volume of
data. Apache spark SQL, Hive, Apache spark streaming, Machine learning
libraries, Apache spark GraphX, SQL libraries, and number of other tool
sets are utilized in this layer to understand underlying data landscape.

Consumption layer
-----------------

This layer consumes the output from the Analytics layer. This layer
receives results from the analytical layer and presents them - also
called as the business intelligence layer using visualization tools,
business processes

The following diagram summarize layers in data management solution

This book is focused using snowflake for big data processing.

Snowflake is a cloud based SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) data warehouse
solution

-  Is faster, easier to use, scalable, and far more flexible
-  has an intuitive simple interface
-  Services can be started quickly and delivers high-quality performance
-  Solves the concurrency issues with its multi-cluster warehouse
   architecture
-  Loads and processes the data quickly
-  Is a fully automated platform
-  Supports auto-scaling, big data workload, and data sharing
-  Allows you to scale up the virtual warehouse and provides elasticity
   as per needs
   
The Snowflake architecture consists of three layers: storage, compute, and services .Each of these layers can be scaled independently. 
So organizations can scale up or down as needed and pay only for the resources they used.

In the Snowflake platform data can be ingested from variety of data formats like Parquet, CSV, ORC, JDBC, ODBC, and XML data sources. 
Supports JSON to the great extent. 

-  Provides full support to create views on different data formats.
-  Allows data sharing support for securely sharing data with other Snowflake accounts. 
-  Permits replication and syncing databases across multiple accounts in different regions. 
-  Enables time travel functions to query the history of data changes over the period. 


Snowflake is cloud-agnostic platform providing a unified data management across multiple cloud service providers like Azure, 
AWS, and GCP. In other words, Snowflake data warehouse can be built on top of the Amazon web services, Microsoft azure 
cloud infrastructure, or google cloud.

Snowflake command line client - SnowSQL can also access all aspects of managing and using Snowflake. 
ODBC and JDBC drivers provides easy connectivity from application/reporting layer to Snowflake.

This book includes:
-  Data Sources
-  Different source data formats, available to build platform
-  Snowflake database development 
-  Snowflake data transformation
-  Data pipeline orchestration
-  Data lineage, pipeline audit and control 
-  SnowSQL and JavaScript based stored procedures
-  Business use cases, we are tasked to solve
-  Data visualization
