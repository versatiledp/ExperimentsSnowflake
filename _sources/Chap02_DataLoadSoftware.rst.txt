Data load software
=============================

Snowflake data load can be achieved 

	-  SnowSQL - CLI allows bulk load data using SQL commands
	-  Snowpipe can be utilized to automate large data set across multiple platforms
	-  Web interfaces can be used to load small amounts of data
	-  Snowflake works with a wide range third party ETL/ELT Informatica, Talend, ADF

SnowSQL CLI 
------------------

SnowSQL is the command line client for Snowflake. It executes SQL queries 
and performs all DDL and DML operations. It is an easy way to access snowflake from the command line. 
It has the same capabilities as the Snowflake UI.

Snowpipe
------------------

Snowpipe is a mechanism to load high frequency or streaming data. 
Snowpipe provides the capability to load the data as soon as it becomes available in a 
defined stage. It can load a near real-time or micro-batch load of data. Snowpipe is serverless architecture,
it does not use virtual warehouse resources. Snowpipe have its own resources, and those are managed by snowflakes instances. 

Snowpipe makes rest API available to load data from 

	-  Amazon web services (AWS) -Amazon S3
	-  Google cloud platform - Cloud Storage
	-  Microsoft azure blob storage, data lake storage gen2
	-  Hadoop and Spark big data platform

All the files in this book are loaded from local folder (like C:\\snowflake\\data\\input\\*.*) to the Snowflake stage area using SnowSQL CLI.

SQL CLI can be invoked with snowsql.exe  

SnowSQL Command Usage

You can use the following command to connect to Snowflake using SnowSQL.


.. code-block:: rst

    snowsql -a accountName -u userName -d databaseName -s schemaName
	
For example, consider the following command to connect Snowflake from Windows command line.

.. code-block:: rst

	snowsql -a xxxxxx.us-east-1 -u xxxxxx -d demo_db -s public
	Password:******
