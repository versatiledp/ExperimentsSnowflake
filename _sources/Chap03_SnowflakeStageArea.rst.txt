Snowflake stage area
============================

Snowflake allows several types of stage. A stage is a temporary storage area in the snowflake warehouse. 
Stage area is used to load data into snowflake tables. 

Snowflake supports two types of stages for storing data files- external and internal.

External stages are storage locations outside the Snowflake environment in another cloud storage location. 
It could Amazon S3 storage, Microsoft Azure storage, and Google Cloud Storage buckets. This provides greater 
flexibility to accessing the data in Snowflake.

	Internal stage stores data files internally within Snowflake. Internal stages can be either permanent or temporary.

	Internal storage is classified into three categories. 

User Stage  
--------------------------

Each snowflake user is attached to the default stage to store the file. This is only accessible by specific user

.. code-block:: rst

	put file://D:\Snowflake\sample_file.csv @~/staged;

The file will be uploaded to user stage and you can verify the same using LIST command.

.. code-block:: rst

	list @~/staged;

The user stages are referenced using @~.

For example, use LIST @~ to list the files in a user stage

Table Stage 
--------------------------

Each table has a Snowflake stage allocated for storing files. Multiple users can access a single table stage area.

.. code-block:: rst

	put file://D:\Snowflake\sample_file.csv @%test;
	
You can also specify the subfolder within the table stage where you want to upload files

.. code-block:: rst

	put file://D:\Snowflake\sample_file.csv @%test/sample_csv/;

The Table stages are referenced using @%tableName.

For example, to list the files in a table stage

.. code-block:: rst

	use LIST @%test

Table stages have the same name as the table. The table stages cannot be altered or dropped.

Table stages do not support setting file format options. Instead, specify file format details in your COPY command.

Internal Named Stage
--------------------------

Internal stages are named database objects. Internal named stages are the recommended stage 
to load the tables. The Internal named stages can be accessed by multiple users. Internal stage can 
load multiple tables. File formats can be specified while creating an internal Named stage.

Internal storage copies data within snowflake warehouse as shown below.
