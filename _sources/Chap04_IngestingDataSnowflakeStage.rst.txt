Ingesting Snowflake stage
========================================================

Internal stage area for IPEDS
----------------------------------------------------

The following diagram presents our files in different formats are used to copy in internal storage.

We are going to load different file formats like CSV, JSON, parquet, and ORC. 
Internal named stage needs to be created for each of the file formats before we load data.

Create internal stage area IPEDS
----------------------------------------------------

Create the file formats & stage area for text file 
1. tab delimited 
2. comma separated with no header
3. comma separated with header

.. include:: \code\chapter04\01_createStagedflatformat.sql
   :code: 
 
--- Create json file format & stage area

.. include:: \code\chapter04\02_createStagedjsonformat.sql
   :code: 

--- Create ORC file format & stage area

.. include:: \code\chapter04\03_createStagedORCformat.sql
   :code: 

--- Create parquet file format & stage area 

.. include:: \code\chapter04\04_createStagedParquetformat.sql
   :code: 

Once these formats are created, we can check available formats to load snowflake internal stage area with

.. code-block:: rst

	-- Check the formats and stage area available in snowflake
	
Summary

We have created an internal named stage in the snowflake to ingest CSV files, parquet file, ORC file, and json files.

We will use the following stage area to load or raw files.

•	IPEDS_ADM 
•	IPEDS_EFFY
•	IPEDS_CM 
•	IPEDS_HD 
•	IPEDS_IC   
  

Load the files to internal stage for IPEDS
----------------------------------------------------

Connect to snowflake database using SnowSQL CLI and load the following files to staging area.

Load academic institution (HDR) files - These are CSV files

.. include:: \code\chapter04\05_LoadCSVfilestoStaged.sql
   :code: 

Load enrollment (EFFY) files  - These are json files

.. include:: \code\chapter04\06_LoadJasonfilestoStaged.sql
   :code: 


Load institutional (IC) charges files  - These are ORC files. All the partitioned are loaded into specific folder of orc staging area

.. include:: \code\chapter04\07_LoadORCfilestoStaged.sql
   :code: 

Load admission files  - These are parquet files. All the partitioned are loaded into specific folder of parquet staging area

.. include:: \code\chapter04\08_LoadParquetfilestoStaged.sql
   :code: 

	
Load code mapping files  - These are csv files.

.. include:: \code\chapter04\09_LoadOtherfilestoStaged.sql
   :code: 

Confirm stage file availability in snowflake

Once these files are loaded to stage area, we can check availability of these data files in the internal stage area as below

.. code-block:: rst

	list command to check the files
