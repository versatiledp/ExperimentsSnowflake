Data platform overview
=============================

Modern data architecture allow enterprises to ingest data coming from
multiple systems, variety of data formats, different speeds, and unknown
intervals. Layered data platform design makes it easy to process big
data efficiently. It enables organizations to quickly deploy new data
analytics business case driven solution to drive revenue and
profitability.

Data source layer
-----------------

-  Data sources can be inside the enterprise or external  
-  Data sources generate data in real-time and batch mode   
-  Variety: Data formats can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured   
-  The Velocity (speed of arrival) and Volume (delivery rate) will differ by sources 

Data processing and storage layer
---------------------------------

Receives data from the source, converts the data into a format
comprehensible for the data servicing and analytics tool, and stores the
data according to its format. For example, Large amount of data can be
stored in a Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) store. Large data
processing can be performed through Hadoop/Spark system. Data may
undergo format changes as it is processed through these systems. Cloud
service providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft allow to build and
operate data-centric applications with infinite scale. Robust and
inexpensive storage is fundamental to the operation and scalability of
big data architecture. 

Big query, azure synapse, redshift, and snowflake
are used as standalone solution for big data processing or in
combination of Hadoop/spark ecosystems

Analytics layer
---------------

The analytical layer reads the data ingested and transformed by the data
processing and storage layer of big data ecosystem. This layer consists
varieties of data analytic tools for different user requirements. This
layer provides the data discovery mechanisms from the huge volume of
data. Apache spark SQL, Hive, Apache spark streaming, Machine learning
libraries, Apache spark GraphX, SQL libraries, and number of other tool
sets are utilized in this layer to understand underlying data landscape.

Consumption layer
-----------------

This layer consumes the output from the Analytics layer. This layer
receives results from the analytical layer and presents them - also
called as the business intelligence layer using visualization tools,
business processes

The following diagram summarize layers in data management solution

This book is focused using snowflake for big data processing.

Snowflake is a cloud based SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) data warehouse
solution

-  Is faster, easier to use, scalable, and far more flexible
-  has an intuitive simple interface
-  Services can be started quickly and delivers high-quality performance
-  Solves the concurrency issues with its multi-cluster warehouse
   architecture
-  Loads and processes the data quickly
-  Is a fully automated platform
-  Supports auto-scaling, big data workload, and data sharing
-  Allows you to scale up the virtual warehouse and provides elasticity
   as per needs
   
The Snowflake architecture consists of three layers: storage, compute, and services .Each of these layers can be scaled independently. 
So organizations can scale up or down as needed and pay only for the resources they used.

In the Snowflake platform data can be ingested from variety of data formats like Parquet, CSV, ORC, JDBC, ODBC, and XML data sources. 
Supports JSON to the great extent. 

-  Provides full support to create views on different data formats.
-  Allows data sharing support for securely sharing data with other Snowflake accounts. 
-  Permits replication and syncing databases across multiple accounts in different regions. 
-  Enables time travel functions to query the history of data changes over the period. 


Snowflake is cloud-agnostic platform providing a unified data management across multiple cloud service providers like Azure, 
AWS, and GCP. In other words, Snowflake data warehouse can be built on top of the Amazon web services, Microsoft azure 
cloud infrastructure, or google cloud.

Snowflake command line client - SnowSQL can also access all aspects of managing and using Snowflake. 
ODBC and JDBC drivers provides easy connectivity from application/reporting layer to Snowflake.

This book includes:
-  Data Sources
-  Different source data formats, available to build platform
-  Snowflake database development 
-  Snowflake data transformation
-  Data pipeline orchestration
-  Data lineage, pipeline audit and control 
-  SnowSQL and JavaScript based stored procedures
-  Business use cases, we are tasked to solve
-  Data visualization

Data load software
=============================

Snowflake data load can be achieved 

-  SnowSQL - CLI allows bulk load data using SQL commands
-  Snowpipe can be utilized to automate large data set across multiple platforms
-  Web interfaces can be used to load small amounts of data
-  Snowflake works with a wide range third party ETL/ELT Informatica, Talend, ADF

SnowSQL CLI 
------------------
SnowSQL is the command line client for Snowflake. It executes SQL queries 
and performs all DDL and DML operations. It is an easy way to access snowflake from the command line. 
It has the same capabilities as the Snowflake UI.

Login into Snowflake and click on help in the top right corner and download

You can also download SnowSQL CLI from the location - URL : https://snowflakesolutions.net/snow-sql-cliclient/

Snowpipe
------------------
Snowpipe is a mechanism to load high frequency or streaming data. 
Snowpipe provides the capability to load the data as soon as it becomes available in a 
defined stage. It can load a near real-time or micro-batch load of data. Snowpipe is serverless architecture,
 it does not use virtual warehouse resources. Snowpipe have its own resources, and those are managed by snowflakes instances. 

Snowpipe makes rest API available to load data from 

-  Amazon web services (AWS) -Amazon S3
-  Google cloud platform - Cloud Storage
-  Microsoft azure blob storage, data lake storage gen2
-  Hadoop and Spark big data platform

All the files in this book are loaded from local folder (like C:\data\*.*) to the Snowflake stage area using SnowSQL CLI.

SQL CLI can be invoked with snowsql.exe  

SnowSQL Command Usage

You can use the following command to connect to Snowflake using SnowSQL.


.. code-block:: rst

    snowsql -a accountName -u userName -d databaseName -s schemaName
	
For example, consider the following command to connect Snowflake from Windows command line.

.. code-block:: rst

	snowsql -a xxxxxx.us-east-1 -u xxxxxx -d demo_db -s public
	Password:******


Snowflake stage area
============================
Snowflake allows several types of stage. A stage is a temporary storage area in the snowflake warehouse. 
Stage area is used to load data into snowflake tables. 

Snowflake supports two types of stages for storing data files- external and internal.

External stages are storage locations outside the Snowflake environment in another cloud storage location. 
It could Amazon S3 storage, Microsoft Azure storage, and Google Cloud Storage buckets. This provides greater 
flexibility to accessing the data in Snowflake.  

.. line-block::

Internal stage stores data files internally within Snowflake. Internal stages can be either permanent or temporary.  
Internal storage is classified into three categories. 


User Stage  
--------------------------
Each snowflake user is attached to the default stage to store the file. This is only accessible by specific user

.. code-block:: rst

	put file://D:\Snowflake\sample_file.csv @~/staged;

The file will be uploaded to user stage and you can verify the same using LIST command.

.. code-block:: rst

	list @~/staged;

The user stages are referenced using @~.

For example, use LIST @~ to list the files in a user stage

Table Stage 
--------------------------

Each table has a Snowflake stage allocated for storing files. Multiple users can access a single table stage area.

.. code-block:: rst

	put file://D:\Snowflake\sample_file.csv @%test;
	
You can also specify the subfolder within the table stage where you want to upload files

.. code-block:: rst

	put file://D:\Snowflake\sample_file.csv @%test/sample_csv/;

The Table stages are referenced using @%tableName.

For example, to list the files in a table stage

.. code-block:: rst

	use LIST @%test

Table stages have the same name as the table. The table stages cannot be altered or dropped.

Table stages do not support setting file format options. Instead, specify file format details in your COPY command.

Internal Named Stage
--------------------------

Internal stages are named database objects. Internal named stages are the recommended stage 
to load the tables. The Internal named stages can be accessed by multiple users. Internal stage can 
load multiple tables. File formats can be specified while creating an internal Named stage.

Internal storage copies data within snowflake warehouse as shown below.


Ingesting data into Snowflake stage
========================================================

Internal stage area for IPEDS
----------------------------------------------------

The following diagram presents our files in different formats are used to copy in internal storage.

We are going to load different file formats like CSV, JSON, parquet, and ORC. 
Internal named stage needs to be created for each of the file formats before we load data.

Create internal stage area IPEDS
----------------------------------------------------

Create the file formats & stage area for text file 
1. tab delimited 
2. comma separated with no header
3. comma separated with header

.. code-block:: rst

	-- Number of header lines at the start of the file. 
	-- The COPY command skips header lines when loading data
	-- All these file formats can be used to create different stage areas	
	CREATE OR REPLACE  FILE FORMAT ff_IPEDS_CSVSkipHeaderTabDelimited
				TYPE =   CSV  
				FIELD_DELIMITER = '\t'  COMPRESSION = AUTO
				SKIP_HEADER = 1 ;      
	CREATE OR REPLACE  FILE FORMAT ff_IPEDS_CSVSkipHeaderCommaDelimited 
				TYPE =   CSV  
				FIELD_DELIMITER = ','  COMPRESSION = AUTO
				SKIP_HEADER = 1;  						  
	-- The COPY command does not skip any lines.  
	CREATE OR REPLACE  FILE FORMAT ff_IPEDS_CSVHeaderTabDelimited
				TYPE =   CSV  
				FIELD_DELIMITER = '\t'  COMPRESSION = AUTO
				SKIP_HEADER = 1 ; 
	CREATE OR REPLACE  FILE FORMAT ff_IPEDS_CSVHeaderCommaDelimited  
				TYPE =   CSV  
				FIELD_DELIMITER = ','  COMPRESSION = AUTO
				SKIP_HEADER = 0 encoding = 'iso-8859-1' 
				FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY='"';  	
	-- create satge area to load csv files for the project
	CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE IPEDS_HD FILE_FORMAT 
				= ff_IPEDS_CSVHeaderCommaDelimited;
	CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE IPEDS_CM FILE_FORMAT 
				= ff_IPEDS_CSVSkipHeaderTabDelimited; 

--- Create json file format & stage area

.. code-block:: rst

	-- Create file format to load json file 
	CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT ff_IPEDS_Json
				TYPE =JSON TRIM_SPACE = TRUE; 
	-- Create stage area to load json  
	CREATE OR REPLACE stage IPEDS_EFFY FILE_FORMAT = ff_IPEDS_Json;


--- Create ORC file format & stage area

.. code-block:: rst

	-- Create file format to load ORC file 
	CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT ff_IPEDS_ORC
				TYPE =ORC TRIM_SPACE = TRUE;
	-- Create stage area to load ORC file 
	CREATE OR REPLACE stage IPEDS_IC FILE_FORMAT = ff_IPEDS_ORC;



--- Create parquet file format & stage area 

.. code-block:: rst

	-- Create Parquet file format
	CREATE OR REPLACE  FILE FORMAT ff_IPEDS_Parquet
				TYPE =PARQUET TRIM_SPACE = TRUE;
	-- Create stage area to load Parquet file 
	CREATE OR REPLACE stage IPEDS_ADM FILE_FORMAT = ff_IPEDS_Parquet;


Once these formats are created, we can check available formats to load snowflake internal stage area with

.. code-block:: rst

	-- Check the formats and stage area available in snowflake
	
Summary

We have created an internal named stage in the snowflake to ingest CSV files, parquet file, ORC file, and json files.

We will use the following stage area to load or raw files.
•	IPEDS_ADM 
•	IPEDS_EFFY
•	IPEDS_CM 
•	IPEDS_HD 
•	IPEDS_IC
